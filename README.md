# Full Stack Project 5 - Casting-Agency-Udacity-Capstone

## Project Overview:
Developed a Casting Agency Application as part of the Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree program at Udacity. The application features secure API endpoints for managing actors and movies, role-based access control (RBAC).

## Goal:
The primary goal of the Full Stack Nanodegree Capstone project is to challenge students to apply all the skills and concepts learned throughout the course, building a complete API from scratch.

## Introduction:
The project required demonstrating proficiency in various areas, including:

* Coding in Python 3
* Relational database architecture
* Modeling data objects with SQLAlchemy
* Developing a Flask API
* Implementing authentication and access with Auth0
* Testing Flask applications


## Tech Stack:

* Python 3
* Flask
* SQLAlchemy
* Internet Protocols and Communication
* Auth0
* Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
* Heroku (cloud platform)

## Project Rubric:
The project rubric consisted of five sections corresponding to each course in the Nanodegree, plus a sixth section for code quality and documentation. The general specifications included building an API on any topic, modeling the data, and making it accessible via the API. The optional Casting Agency Specs provided more detailed requirements for the API structure.

## Key Features:

* Designed and secured all API endpoints for the application
* Architected relational database models in Python using SQLAlchemy for database queries
* Utilized REST APIs to structure endpoints that respond to four HTTP methods with error handling
* Implemented Role-Based Authentication and role-based access control (RBAC) in a Flask application
* Conducted extensive testing for expected success and error behavior of each endpoint using the unittest library
* Integrated Auth0 for third-party authentication with role-based access control (RBAC)


## Achievements:

* Successfully designed a secure and functional Casting Agency Application
* Implemented role-based access control for improved security and user management
* Utilized modern web development techniques and best practices


## Memo for Advanced App in Future
* Make the frontend.
* Deploy app.
