# Full Stack Project 5 - Casting-Agency-Udacity-Capstone

## Goal:
The goal of the Full Stack Nanodegree Capstone project is to challenge the students to utilize all the skills and concepts learned throughout the course to build a complete API from scratch and deploy it.

## Introduction:
The project requires the students to demonstrate their proficiency in various areas including coding in Python 3, relational database architecture, modeling data objects with SQLAlchemy, developing a Flask API, authentication and access, testing Flask applications, and deploying applications.

## Tech Stacks:

* Coding in Python 3
* Relational Database Architecture
* Modeling Data Objects with SQLAlchemy
* Internet Protocols and Communication
* Developing a Flask API
* Authentication and Access
* Authentication with Auth0
* Authentication in Flask
* Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
* Testing Flask Applications
* Deploying Applications


The students will use Python 3, Flask, and SQLAlchemy to build the API. They will also learn about authentication and access using Auth0 and role-based access control (RBAC). Testing the Flask applications and deploying the applications will also be covered.

The project rubric includes five sections, one for each course in the Nanodegree, and a fifth section for code quality and documentation. There are also general specifications that the students must follow, including building an API about any topic, modeling the data, and making it accessible via the API. The optional Casting Agency Specs provide more detailed requirements for the API structure.

Lastly, the students will learn how to deploy their application to a cloud platform, such as Heroku or Render.
